# PM2.5 Forecasting – Colombo (Kirulapone)

PM2.5 Air Quality Forecasting for Kirulapone (Colombo)
Predicting hourly PM2.5 pollution levels using time‑series deep learning models (LSTM and N‑BEATS) with key evaluation metrics. This project was completed as the final research project for the Higher National Diploma in Data Science (HNDDS) at NIBM.

## Project Structure


## Features

- Data Preprocessing: clipping, log transformation, scaling  
- Sequence Creation: prepare time-series data for model input  
- Deep Learning Models: LSTM and N-BEATS  
- Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE  
- Academic research project: part of **HNDDS final research at NIBM**

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook notebooks/pm25_lstm_nbeats.ipynb

Trained models (optional):

LSTM: models/lstm_pm25_model.h5

N-BEATS: models/nbeats_pm25_model.pth

Note: Trained models are not included. Run the notebook to train locally.

Customize preprocessing or model parameters in src/ scripts.

This is **everything you need** to push your repo to GitHub:  

- `src/` with clean scripts  
- `notebooks/` for workflow  
- `data/` folder for your CSVs  
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies  
- `.gitignore` to keep repo clean  
- README highlighting **NIBM HNDDS final research**

If you want, I can **also draft a ready-to-copy `LICENSE` (dual academic/commercial) for this repo** so you can just add it and push.  

Do you want me to do that?
